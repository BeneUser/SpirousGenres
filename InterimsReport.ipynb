    "#### Possible Audio Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on: [Audio Data Augmentation Techniques: The Theory by Valerio Velardo - The Sound of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm1cQfb_pLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation for audio can be applied in two principal ways: directly on the waveform, or on the spectrogram (time–frequency) representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Velardo (2020) presents a comprehensive overview of augmentation techniques, though not all are equally suitable for musical data. The two methods identified as most effective for music are time stretching, which alters the playback speed without changing pitch, and pitch scaling, which modifies the pitch while maintaining the original tempo. Additional approaches that can be beneficial include noise addition (e.g., white, pink, or background noise) and impulse response addition (introducing various types of reverberation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Care must be taken to avoid excessive distortion, as overly aggressive augmentation can render audio samples unrepresentative of their original genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further experimentation will be required to determine which augmentation techniques are most effective in improving genre classification performance within this project."
